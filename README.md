## About
One of the most frustrating feelings that a person experiences is the inability to put one's thoughts into words. In today's society, being able to fluently and accurately convey one's perceptions and beliefs is a very underrated and overlooked skill someone can possess. 

Learning one word per day has been proven to be a very efficient way to improve a person's vocabulary, and with the help of the WOTD Bot, it couldn't be easier. Once every morning the bot sends out a message containing a new word, a definition, an example, as well as it's part of speech; (noun, verb, adjective, etc.). If someone missed the message and would like to have it repeated, the bot also provides the same message when prompted by the "!wotd" command. If a user is ever confused or stuck, there is also a "!wotdHelp" command that displays all commands and a link to the bot's documentation. This provides an easy way to build a habit of learning and growing each day with very little to no effort required.
